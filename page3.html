<center><p>I just wanted to show my dream car models for the last page of the project, I hope that I gave a glimpse of what JDM car models are. Especially that I think the two previous cars were two of the most iconic cars for cars in general. Yes I am currently working to buying one of my dream models (you guys might not care but just wanted to point that out).</p></center>
